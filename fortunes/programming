In the information age, the barriers [to entry into programming] just aren't
there. The barriers are self imposed. If you want to set off and go develop
some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You
need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to
work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors.
We waded across rivers.

Programming is really just the mundane aspect of expressing a solution
to a problem. There are talents that are specifically related to actually
coding, but the real issue is being able to grasp problems and devise solutions
that are detailed enough to actually be coded.

Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.

The reason is not to glorify "bit chasing"; a more fundamental issue is at
stake here: Numerical subroutines should deliver results that satisfy simple,
useful mathematical laws whenever possible. [...] Without any underlying
symmetry properties, the job of proving interesting results becomes
extremely unpleasant. The enjoyment of one's tools is an essential ingredient
of successful work.

I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. ... They carefully told me,
computers could only do arithmetic; they could not do programs.

The Feynman Algorithm:

1. Write down the problem.
2. Think real hard.
3. Write down the solution.

There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about.
It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The
trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them!

The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his
own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and
among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague.

Don't blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as an
intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for "the average programmer" â€”
you must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical technique because it
is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his shop around the corner.
